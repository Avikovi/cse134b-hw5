Changes made:

Removed some elements that I found to be not as useful (mainly in the HTML). Some examples of these include the audio/video in the about page, the additional work experience in the experience page (due ot them not being as related to my major), specializations in the skills page (not as important as the languages on the page), dialog box in contact page (more annoying than helpful), title size changes on education page (looked too big before)
